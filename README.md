# The-Children-of-Cronos
This was a project I made in my second year of Mechtronics & Robotics Engineering degree as part of a module of embedded systems. The purpose was to create a piece of software (most likely a game) to interact with the electronics we created in our lab (photo below).

The microcontroller we used was a FRDM-K64F from NXP and the code was all written in C++ using the online IDE of mbed that I also used for online source control.

This video-game was made out of 5 mini games inspired by popular old games like snake, space invaders and other more recent ones like flappy birds. Such a variety of mini games let me learn a lot about different game dynamics. Moreover, I used a common tematic based on the Greek mythology (each game represented one of the children of the titan Cronos) to connect all the mini games and make a bigger clearer picture specially for the point system that the game was using. 

Each mini game was created in a separate C++ library with its classes and objects that then were imported into the main cpp game file that connected all of them and added some other extra functionalities like lighting and intro/outro screens. The games took use of all the electronic feautures avalaiable (sound effects, screen restrictions, storage using a SD card, lightning, a potentiometer, a joystick, several buttons and battery saving spenses). 

This was one of my first programming big projects and the one that made me decide to focus more on software development as I really loved and enjoyed it.
